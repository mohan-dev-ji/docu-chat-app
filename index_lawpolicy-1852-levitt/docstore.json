Eagleson, PhD** INTRODUCTION  This review explains why \u201cearly\u201d matters when it comes to brain and child development. Early is a critical concept that I and others have presented to policy makers and business leaders throughout the country. Early typically includes the prenatal and the first three years after birth. Here we focus on the early postnatal period. In addition, the adolescent period represents a distinct epoch of developmental changes. Positive development of children provides a strong foundation for healthy and competent adulthood, responsible citizenship, economic productivity, strong communities, and a just and fair society1.  Below, we discuss the foundational principles of brain development that underlie why this is the case. For much of the material presented here, it is important to acknowledge the contributions of the Center for the Developing Child at Harvard University and the National Scientific Council for the Developing Child.2 The Center provides many resources, including material that will be covered in this review, on their website.3 It is also important to recognize the FrameWorks Institute,4 a non-profit organization comprised of social scientists, cultural anthropologists and linguists that has worked with the  * Simms/Mann Chair in Developmental Neurogenetics, Institute for the Developing Mind, Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, Provost Professor of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine of University of Southern California, Senior Fellow, Center on the Developing Child at Harvard University and Co-Scientific Director of the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child. ** Associate Professor of Research of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine Of University of Southern California, Investigator in Institute for the Developing Mind and Research on Children, Youth and Families, Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. 1.

For example, Nat Kendall-Taylor, the Chief Executive Officer of FrameWorks, and Pat Levitt co-authored a NeuroView article about how science advocacy is not just about asking policy makers for more money for research, which of course is important5: equally important is informing decision-makers, such as policy makers, business leaders, health service providers, educators and members of the public, who can make a difference in changing the approach towards investing in programs that improve healthy brain and child development.   I. MISCONCEPTIONS OF BRAIN AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT  There are some common misconceptions about development that often influence decisions about effect investment of resources:  A. Children are sponges who develop and learn simply by passively experiencing their environment.  Decades of research have demonstrated that learning is an active process6. Further, development of cognition and emotional regulation occurs in the context of social interactions for humans as well as all vertebrate species7. If there's one message to take from this review, it is that affiliative social interaction is a critical component of cognitive and emotional development, and both are impacted negatively in its absence\u2014known as \u201cneglect.\u201d Moreover, effective programs work because they facilitate interaction between the caregiver and the infant, and the caregiver and professionals, improving skills in the child and primary caregivers.8  5.

Eighty percent of brain development occurs by age two.  In the neuroimaging field, from the perspective of brain volume, this is accurate.9 But, brain development and brain size are not equivalent concepts.  The former includes the assembly and maturation of circuits that underlie higher cognitive, sensory, and motor functions. This process provides each infant and toddler with the ability to take in information from his or her environment, try to interpret and make sense out of the information, and subsequently generate a motor response. The brain, particularly the cerebral cortex10, continues to grow through the juvenile period. It reaches its peak size just before the onset of puberty,11 after which pruning of synapses and neuronal processes (i.e. normal reduction in gray matter) contribute to the reduction of brain volume observed in adulthood.12 However, the brains of two-year-olds are not eighty percent of an adult in their functional capacities. Therefore, while brain size may be at eighty percent, an enormous amount of development continues over time, even into young adulthood for certain circuits; all this neurobiological activity simply occurs at a much more structurally subtle level.   C. Bad stuff happens\u2014you just have to tough it out and you\u2019ll be fine.  This concept, which some erroneously define as resilience (resilience as defined by the National Science Council on the Developing Child13) is rooted deeply in our culture.

Thus, we believe that this cultural frame may create a challenge for child welfare and juvenile justice programs and policies to recognize that \u201ctoughing it out\u201d is not a path for making things better15.   D. Ready to learn is all about cognitive development.  Intervention programs that focus solely on learning without addressing social-emotional development are counter to how the brain works. Children grow up in an environment of relationships, and integrating social, emotional and cognitive development is key.16   E. Teens are in more car accidents because they have a hole in their frontal lobe.  This popular concept appears to have influenced a graphic used in an insurance advertisement from Allstate Insurance.17 But, are teens really missing part of their brain? To understand what is occurring in the teenage brain requires taking a step back to first understand the fundamentals of brain assembly and the nature-nurture factors that influence this process.   II. BUILDING CIRCUITS IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN  For the purposes of this Article, we will summarize a primer of the biological events that contribute to human brain development.18 Neurons are cells specialized to carry messages from one part of the brain to another. They have processes (axons) that serve to send information to the next neuron in line, with millions eventually coalescing to form tracts (white matter) that continue to grow in size throughout adolescence.19  14.

The cell bodies of the neuron, their dendrites, and their synapses form the gray matter, which grows in size through childhood.20  This early gray matter growth occurs even though no new neurons are added.21 In contrast, the growth of neuron processes that receive input is very robust. Indeed, from the third trimester through the age of two, there are approximately one million synapses added per second in the cerebral cortex.22 Later in development, the gray matter becomes smaller over time due to the systematic elimination of connections that serve no purpose (determined by their limited use during development). How do we explain that in the adult brain each neuron receives approximately two to three thousand synapses, while in a developing child\u2019s brain there actually may be twice as many synapses formed? There is a natural process, called pruning, which begins in late childhood, prior to the onset of puberty.23 Because puberty timing varies across children, the timing of when synapses are lost is heterogeneous. Thus, for some children, this process may begin as early as seven years or as late as eleven years of age. The pruning process is influenced by the interaction of the child with his or her environments, through experiences that impact the activity of neural circuits.24 Thus, the process stabilizes synapses that are used through having experiences\u2014for example, using both eyes to fine tune binocular vision\u2014and eliminates the synapses that are not activated sufficiently over time. The organization of the connections is highly dependent upon experience; neurons in the same circuit that activate together end up wiring together.25 Further, a synaptic connection\u2019s use  20.

If synapses are not used often, then they are more likely to be lost.26 This means, by definition, that experience during development\u2014beginning prenatally and extending well into postnatal life\u2014is preeminent in driving development of the brain. Moreover, experience drives development in typically-developing children, in children with intellectual disabilities, and children with other special needs. That is, the brain of a child who has been diagnosed with an intellectual disability or a genetic disorder that affects brain circuits and functions still changes over time due to experiences. Because the circuits may be disrupted and thus not process information as in typically-developing children, the information is likely to be interpreted differently. This, in turn, will impact experience-dependent development of synapses and circuits. If experience is so powerful as a driver of brain development, what is the role of genes inherited from parents?  Two principles are essential here. First, early in development, prior to experience from the environment, genes establish the blueprint for the basic structure of the brain, including the production, during prenatal development, of nearly all the neurons that an individual will have for his or her life.27 In other words, genes provide the fundamental basis for establishing brain architecture. Second, genes are designed to be controlled in ways that impact whether they will be expressed (or not), at what specific times, and at which locations in the brain.28 In fact, there have been recent studies documenting that gene expression in the developing brain is highly dynamic and complex.29 Moreover, the combination of genes expressed may differ between major neuron types, as different neuronal classes have distinct projections and functions in processing information. Research increasingly suggests that experiences, positive or negative, impact how  26. Carla J. Shatz, The Developing Brain, 267 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN 60-67 (1992). 27. Sharon E.

Epigenetic processes impact other organ systems as they mediate responses to experiences, such as early life stress.33  It is quite profound that the brain uses the natural experiences of the organism to facilitate its own development. However, it does not filter good experiences from bad. During development, experiences that deviate from the norm, such as early life stress, can challenge how the brain assembles circuits, creating adaptations to prepare the child to cope with what the brain thinks it will encounter later in life.34 For example, in studies of rodent auditory development, for rats that were raised to hear only one frequency of sound during the experience-expectant period of development when auditory circuitry is being established, the neurons in those circuits were most adept at discerning the frequency to which it was exposed, and much poorer at discerning other frequencies.35 This is a problem when the rat would need to survive in a world of diverse sound frequencies, such as detecting sounds made by their natural predators. If never exposed to those frequencies, their circuits would be poor at identifying the presence of the predator. Thus, the altered development is actually mal-adaptive.   30. Sarah C. P.

Thus, very early on one can measure a child\u2019s very basic sensory modalities and motor skills, as pediatricians do at well-baby visits. Later, more complex cognitive, social and emotional circuits assemble in the same experience-dependent fashion.38 However, to process information from experiences, the brain heavily depends upon sensory circuits to be fine-tuned as early as possible.39 At birth, the brain is ready to mediate social engagement with adults in their environment, particularly primary caregivers who provide the most substantive stimuli and security.

Yet, from a developmental perspective, it is very important to provide opportunities for the infant to initiate interactions as well\u2014the game gets old quickly when the adult is doing all the serving. Moreover, social contexts are essential for cognitive development.42 For language, research shows that the number of words an infant hears in a social setting directly correlates with the complexity of vocabulary (and use) that the child will develop.43 Teaching language in the absence of a social context doesn't work, as it is a mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved.  IV. THE POWER OF EARLY EXPERIENCES \u2013 POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE  A study done by Seth Pollock and colleagues in 2002 speaks to the issue of early experience having a long-lasting and powerful impact on childhood development.44  In this study, researchers asked young children with a history of physical abuse to distinguish between images of emotions in still face expressions. Across eleven images, facial expressions morphed from happy to fearful, or from happy to sad.45 While the study divided participants into two groups\u2014those who had experienced abuse and those who had not\u2014all were able to distinguish the transition between those emotions46. What about when comparing angry to fearful, and angry to sad? Here, the two groups showed a disparity: children who had not experienced abuse could distinguish emotions while those who had experienced abuse over-represented anger.47 This is a powerful study illustrating that because of the early life experience of abuse, in which there is an overabundance of anger \u201csignals,\u201d children\u2019s ability to  42.

In a sense, their survival depends upon the child being in high threat detection mode, even if they exhibit biases in over-representing the specific anger emotion. In contrast, in other studies of children who experienced severe neglect, their capacity to distinguish between emotions appears to be blunted.48 Chronic activation of the stress response system, in the absence of supportive relationships, can produce a toxic stress response in the child49. Importantly, the absence of serve and return\u2014that is, neglect\u2014represents nearly eighty percent of child maltreatment.50 Neglect is a major risk factor for both physical and mental health problems in childhood and later in life51. Yet, unless neglect generates physical risk for the child, physicians may not recognize it as a threat to healthy brain and child development.  V.

Toxic stress, as a term was developed by the National Scientific Council on the Developing Child in 2005, in the taxonomy of positive and tolerable stress that reflects the fact that not all challenges to our emotional regulatory circuits are bad. It is important to emphasize that in this taxonomy, the terms do not represent the stimulus. There are many sources of stress, including those that typically produce toxic stress (abuse, neglect, violence, limited resources), as well as those that may strengthen a child\u2019s stress response (meeting new people, talking in front of others in preschool, novel environments); see also Excessive Stress Disrupts the Architecture of the Developing Brain 1-16 (Nat\u2019l Sci.

This extended period of development provides opportunities for brain plasticity that interventions target. But, in the absence of interventions, early disruption of executive function development predicts poor life outcomes.53 Risk thus is greater for physical and mental health problems, as well as higher incarceration rates, lower high school graduation rates, and reduced family wealth.54  What is executive function? The National Scientific Council on the Developing Child summarizes four features of executive function, using the metaphor of an air traffic controller as an example of someone who requires purposeful control over the following brain features to optimally perform their job55: 1) exhibiting selective attention to the most salient stimuli in the environment, while suppressing interfering stimuli; 2) working and long-term memory that allows one to remember facts, hold them online, and which serve to solve a current problem; 3) control of actions\u2014selecting appropriate responses to a situation, and inhibiting those that may interfere; and 4) inhibitory control\u2014suppressing emotions that may interfere with problem-solving and reappraisal of situations. These skills begin to emerge in late infancy and in early toddlers.56 A growing number of studies have looked at the impact of early executive function disruption on long-term outcomes. A Dunedin, New Zealand study has followed subjects born between 1972 and 1973,57 Of the 1,037 children initially enrolled at age three, they have data on 972, a remarkable retention rate over this extended period of time. This study demonstrates that measurements showing low executive function skills in toddlers predicts increased risk for poor mental and physical health  53. Terrie E.

The economic analyses show that when you calculate physical health outcomes in middle age adults who were in that pre-school program, compared to the community sample without high quality preschool, there are lower rates of high blood pressure, pre-diabetes insulin resistance, obesity and cardiovascular disease.60 These outcomes have developmental origins.

Gray matter is reduced in size during this period,64 reflecting pruning of connections that are not stabilized by experience. In contrast, over the same period, white matter continues to develop, mostly because of additional myelination,65 particularly in brain areas most vulnerable and sensitive to early adversity such as the prefrontal cortex and parts of the temporal lobe.66 Keep in mind that there is a tremendous amount of variability in individuals across the population in terms of the timing of when the brains of juveniles and adolescents go through the changes in gray and white matter. Thus, while the fields of developmental psychology and neuroscience define average ages for the appearance of functional structural milestones, there is a lot of variation. This has implications for understanding the maturational state of the brain based on function and structure, rather than simply chronological age.  During adolescence, different circuits undergo maturational changes at different rates. B.J. Casey and others have developed a model in which there is an imbalance between the developmental trajectory of the connectivity between prefrontal cortex (control system) and 1) the amygdala, which is involved in threat detection and emotional regulation, and 2) other parts of the brain which are involved in motivation and reward.67 Until these control and emotional regulatory regions reach similar maturation states in post adolescence, complex functions that are the ingredients of executive function, such as of decision-making, inhibitory control and response suppression may be challenging. The go/no-go task requires an individual to resist their initial impulse to perform a task when they see a stimulus on a video screen. Children, adolescents and adults can do the simple suppression similarly. But, when  63. Brain Dev.

The imbalances noted above may underlie the risk-taking and other decisions made by adolescents that put them at greater risk.  WHAT IS NEUROSCIENCE TELLING US?  More and more intervention programs recognize that healthy brain development is the foundational biological construct for positive child, adolescent and adult outcomes. Understanding that children grow up in an environment of relationships translates into targeting the natural serve and return relationships that are at the heart of cognitive and social-emotional skill-building and executive functioning. These skills are part of the recipe for building resilience\u2014the adaptability to challenges that may otherwise negatively impact short- and long-term outcomes for children. Like physical illnesses such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, intervention programs in the world of promoting healthy brain and child development often produce heterogeneous responses to the intervention, working very well for some and poorly for others. Neuroscience tells us that variation in development is normal. When we become more precise, determining the factors that influenced an intervention that worked so well for some families and so poorly for other families, innovation in the form of targeted approaches will become the norm.     68.
